# ðŸŽ¯ Never-Miss Dartboard

> A real-time stereo-vision system that tracks darts midair and dynamically adjusts a projected dartboard to guide each throw toward a near-perfect bullseye.

## Overview

This project uses **two Raspberry Pi V2 cameras** mounted at perpendicular angles to track the 3D position of a dart in real-time. A **physics-based Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)** fuses the asynchronous 2D observations into a smooth 3D trajectory estimate. 

Once a dart is thrown, the system:
- Detects it via blob tracking
- Predicts its final landing position
- Reprojects the dartboard to make the dart appear to hit a near bullseye every time.

## Features

- Real-time stereo dart tracking using low-cost Raspberry Pi cameras at ~45 FPS
- 3D Kalman filtering with gravity and air drag modeling
- Automatic prediction and projection correction
- Low-latency: ~200ms from throw to prediction
